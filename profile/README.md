[**Serenity/JS**](https://serenity-js.org/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github) is an innovative **test automation framework** designed to help you create
**high-quality, business-focused test scenarios** that interact with **any interface of your system**
and produce **comprehensive test reports** that **build trust** between delivery teams and the business.

Serenity/JS can help you with:
- [**Test reporting**](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github) - Serenity/JS
  integrates with popular test runners, including [Cucumber.js](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github),
  [Mocha](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/mocha/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github),
  [Jasmine](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github),
  [Protractor](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/protractor/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github),
  and [Playwright Test](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/`?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github`),
  to help you produce **in-depth**, **illustrated test execution reports** and [**living documentation**](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation) of your system.
- [**Test design**](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/) - Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github) APIs enable you
  to create multi-actor test scenarios that capture your **domain vocabulary**, model your **business workflows**, and help you write **high-quality test automation code** you can reuse across projects and teams.
- [**Test integration**](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/integration/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github) - Serenity/JS
  works with web, mobile, and HTTP/REST interfaces. Thanks to the [modular architecture](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/about/architecture/?pk_campaign=readme&pk_source=github) of the framework, you can also extend it to work with anything a Node.js program can talk to.
